        <p> A faint blue light from an unexplicable source envelops the seemingly endless corridor. This light, or perhaps strange aura, illuminates two doors opposite to each other. There is nothing else in here besides pure darkness. I enter through one of the doors, where 
            a large gathering of people are present. My aunt greets me, and the rest of my extended family, who I haven't seen in ages welcome me inside. But there's an weird tension in the air as they begin gossiping...? I exit and enter through the next door, where I
            instantly change into a swimsuit and carefully enter the black tunnel. Water rushes past me as I slide down and end up catapulting into a large pool, where other people where relaxing and just having fun. Returning to the shabby platform, I overlook an amateurly built indoor waterpark from a great height. The slides definitely aren't sturdy, but my sister and nieces insist on sliding down the tubes with me over and over again. Returning to the dark hallway, 
            I keep wondering about what's at the end of this void.
