        <p> Running as fast as we could, we made our way out through the window as we were chased by a man we had never seen before. I didn't know who this girl was either, but that didn't matter; all we knew was that we needed to get far away from him. 
            We continued running, and running, and running, and we ran all the way down to the bottom of that fire escape. Once we reached the bottom, the railings and the steps began to warp rapidly Alice-in-Wonderland style, expanding and melting into an amorphous pile of steel.
