<h1> Strange Encounter </h1>
    
<h2> Jumping across roofs. It's dangerous but I do it anyways. The sky is a gentle shade of pink and snow covers the ground I stand on. </h2>
<h2> A camera man follows my for whatever unknown reason, capturing my movements silently. </h2>
<h2> Something catches my eye. I have seen creatures like this before... but this is unfamiliar. </h2>
